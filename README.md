# CLT
Classical Laminate Theory program for composite material analysis and calculations. Written in MATLAB.

# Introduction
I wrote this for my Mechanics of Compositie Materials class, EAS4240, during my senior year. It was developed on iteravitely over the course of the semester, adding more calculations and accounting for more material properties of the composities to enhance accuracy. Stress, strain, tensile, compression, shear, layer orientation, thermal expansion, failure criterion, to name a handful of things the program accounts for.

# Disclosure
I know for sure that these files are not totally perfect, since my score on the final exam wasn't (although I was close), so considered this provided "as is". The fault probably lies in some of the material near the end of the course since I didn't have as much time to refine it. Stresses and strains should be fine. The thermal stuff should be fine as well, if I recall. My best guess is that the issues pop up somewhere in the failure envelope calculations.

# Acknowledgement
A big "Thank You!" to Dr. Ifju for being a great professor and generally good guy. I may not have spoken to you much one-on-one but I appreciated your approach to teaching and running your courses.
